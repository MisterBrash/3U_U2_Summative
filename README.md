##### ICS3 - Mr. Brash üêøÔ∏è


## Review

**At this point in the course we can:**
- Create a web "page" (document) using [basic HTML tags](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_syntax.asp)

- Connect our HTML page to JavaScript code
- Print values and text to the [console](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_console_log.asp)
- Use [variables](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_let.asp) to store and manipulate data - numbers, text ("Strings"), or booleans (`true` and `false`)
- Calculate various [Mathematics](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_obj_math.asp) and [concatonate Strings](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/concatenating-strings-with-plus-operator) or use [Template Strings](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_string_templates.asp)
- [Create our own functions](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_functions.asp) in JavaScript to help chunk code into smaller pieces
    - Use [parameters](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_function_parameters.asp) and [return statements](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_return.asp) in our functions to help pass around data
- Create triggers with [event listeners](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_htmldom_eventlistener.asp) and modify HTML content [using JavaScript](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_intro.asp)
