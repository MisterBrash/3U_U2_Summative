# 2.6 - Connecting HTML to JavaScript

##### ICS3 - Mr. Brash 🐿️

#### The time has come! We are going to connect the front-end (HTML) to the back-end (JS)!

**If you missed the live demonstration in class, read below. Otherwise you can go straight to [your task](./YOUR_TASK.md).**

## 🔍 "Talking to" HTML Elements from JavaScript

**Unique IDs:** All HTML elements you wish to control with JavaSscript _must_ have a unique identifier.

```HTML
index.html

<div id="score">100</div>

<button id="quit_button">Quit</button>

<img id="options" src="./images/options.png">
```

**The `document` object** To read or modify elements on a page, we use the JavaScript [`document`](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_htmldom_document.asp) object, similar to how we used the `console` object for printing or `Math` object for mathing.

```JS
main.js

let score_div = document.getElementById("score");

// Modify the score
score_div.textContent = 150;
```

> ☝ It's important to understand that [`document.getElementById()`](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_document_getelementbyid.asp) returns the actual _Node_ or _Element_ on the page not just the text or value of that object.


### 💻 Your Turn to Try!

The [index.html](./index.html) page has a `<div>` element called "try_me". Go to the dev console try getting or changing the text inside the div:
```JS
let my_div = document.getElementById("try_me");

console.log(my_div.textContent);

my_div.textContent = "Hi mom!";
```


## 👂 Event Listeners

When a user interacts with a webpage (click, mouse move, key press, etc) this creates _events_. You can find [the entire list of events online](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/dom_obj_event.asp).

In order to have the event trigger some code (maybe the user clicked on an image), we tell the HTML document to **listen** for that specific **event**. This is called **setting up an event listener**.

### There are two ways to listen for an event:

**1. In HTML (the easy method):**
```HTML
Use the "on" event trigger:
<img id="options" src="./images/options.png" onclick="load_options()">
```

This approach _assumes_ that the JavaScript is ready and loaded properly. It causes us to put JS code in two places - the document _and_ the JS file. Similar to how we separate out the CSS, we would rather _not_ use the above method.

**2. In JavaScript (the preferred method):**
```JS
// Setup an Event Listener
document.getElementById("options").addEventListener("click", load_options);
```
### 💻 Your Turn:

On the [index.html](./index.html) file is a button that says "Roll a D6". 

Let's make a function that will pretent to roll a 6-sided die and place the results in the `<span>` called "die_roll".
```JS
function rolld6() {
    document.getElementById("die_roll").textContent = randInt(1, 6);
}
```

Now let's add an _event listener_ on line 12 to make the button clickable:
```JS
document.getElementById("d6").addEventListener("click", rolld6);
```

Now go click the button a couple times!


> **❓ Can you make the "Roll a D8" button work?**

## Getting Input

Our page also contains an input box:
```HTML
 <input id="user_input" type="text" ... >
```

It is asking for the user's name. Let's say hello to them when they click the "Enter" button.

**Step 1** - Create the function
```JS
function say_hello() {
    // Get what the user entered
    let name = document.getElementById("user_input").value;

    // Say hello
    document.getElementById("greeting").textContent = `Hello ${name}!`;
}
```

**Step 2** - Create the Event Listener on the Enter button (typically all listeners are placed at the top of your code file)
```JS
document.getElementById("enter").addEventListener("click", say_hello);
```

Congratulations!! You can now make your webpages _interactive_!
